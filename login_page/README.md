# Simple Login Page

This project consists of a basic HTML page with a form containing two input elements for username and password, and a button. The JavaScript code checks the validation of the password when the button is clicked. If the password length is less than 6 characters, an error message is displayed on the page, and the password input box is highlighted with a red border. If the password length is 6 or more characters, a success message is displayed.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file with the form.
- **style.css** (optional): CSS file for styling the HTML page.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file for handling the password validation.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter a username and password.
4. Click the "Submit" button to validate the password.

## Styling (Optional)

You can customize the styling of the HTML page by modifying the `style.css` file.

## Validation Logic

The JavaScript code in `script.js` checks the length of the password and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
